Welcome!

My repo's consist of:
      - Scripts for automated content production in Maya (MEL or Python)
      - Scripts for Unreal Engine to automate tasks. (Python)
      - Personal computer vision projects, based on hand and head tracking.

Please not that most is work in progress and some code needs to be changed for your own use.
Just drop me a line if you need any help.

I'll add documentation at a later point (Q3 2022) and if time permits even some GUI's.

Cheers,

Bart
